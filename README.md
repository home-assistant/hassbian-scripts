## Hassbian-scripts

These are the scripts used in the [HASSbian](https://github.com/home-assistant/pi-gen) image.
The scripts in this repository where made to be used with the HASSbian image and the included Home Assistant instance.  

## The included scripts
The following scripts are currently included. You can view the documentation below for usage and instructions.

### hassbian-config (hassbian-config)
This command is a package handler for the Hassbian scripts. All interactions for installing software should be handled through this command. Running the individual scripts to install software will no longer work as expected.

#### Usage
The hassbian-config command is invoked with:
```bash
hassbian-config *command* *suite*
```
where command is one of:
- `install`
- `upgrade`
- `show`
- `log`
- `share-log`

##### install
The install command takes one argument and will attempt to install the indicated suite of software.
Generally, this means that the invocation of `hassbian-config` should be run as root, with:
`sudo hassbian-config install *suite*`
##### upgrade
The install command takes one argument and will attempt to install the indicated suite of software.
Generally, this means that the invocation of `hassbian-config` should be run as root, with:
`sudo hassbian-config upgrade *suite*`
##### show
The show command can be run without arguments, and lists all available suites which can be installed or with a *suite* name as argument and shows information about the suite .
##### log
This command shows the log from the last `hassbian-config` operation.
##### share-log
This command creates an easy to share hastebin link of your last `hassbian-config` operation.
