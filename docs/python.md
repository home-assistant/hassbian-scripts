## Description
It is not recomended running this script.  
**It is recomended to download and install the newest [Hassbian image](https://github.com/home-assistant/pi-gen/releases/latest) instead of running this.**  
This script will upgrade Python to the latest stable version.  
It will also create a new virtual environment to be used for Home Assistant.  
_This upgrade takes long time to finish._  
_This prosess takes about a hour on an Raspberry Pi 3_

## Upgrade
```
$ sudo hassbian-config upgrade python
```

## Additional info
If you have installed additional components directly to `/srv/homeassistant/` like `libcec` thoese will need to be reinstalled.
