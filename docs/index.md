[`hassbian-scripts`](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassbian-scripts) contains two parts:

- [Suites](/hassbian-scripts/suites) that are prebuilt scripts designed to run on [Hassbian](https://github.com/home-assistant/pi-gen).
- [`hassbian-config`](/hassbian-scripts/cli) which is our package manager.
